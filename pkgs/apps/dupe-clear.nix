# Package for Kindle v1.17, the last version before KFX downloads were added.
# Note that the system trust store needs to have a specific verisign root certificate
# installed. See nixos/features/kindle/default.nix in this repo for that bit, plus
# a script to extract the decryption key from the installed app.
